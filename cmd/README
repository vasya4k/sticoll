I thought it needs an explanation as even I wrote this it was hard to understdand what is going on here after a while.

I wish Juniper would be doing this differently, but they are not.
A router or a switch just streams KV pairs in portions of data contained inside na_pb.OpenConfigData data type.

KV pairs  belonging to a single entity say a physical interface are separated by a key called "__prefix__."
But then there can be multiple occurrences of different fieldsets which belong to the same interface even within one OC data packet.
That means you can recieve information about the same inerface multiple times but it would be different info. 
For example first you get interface state and then you get the counters.

Also, data types do not contain all the fields one would reasonably want.
Say you want to get all the availible information about an interface counters, queue stats, state, description.
To get the aforementioned data you need to collect it from three different telemetry packets.  

You can imagine how complex this can get as I have to use multiple flags
to track which data types have already been collected.

Both functions assignIfDataAndSend() and handleInterfaceState() can write to a channel or a DB.
This is because we want data to be as fresh as possible, we got new data we ship it even not all data will be updated. 

SELECT derivative(mean("counters_out_octets"),1s) *8 FROM "phy_interface"  WHERE ("name" = 'ge-0/0/0') AND $timeFilter GROUP BY time(2s) fill(null)
